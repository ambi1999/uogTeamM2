Our Team Proposal:
The software we have decided to create will be used for pleasure. It is portraying the fun side to the Arduino’s uses. 
Basically, we have a piano board with seven keys. When each key is pressed, a different LED lights up and a different sound is heard. The LED lights are formed to be in the shape of a man, and the idea is to make it look like he is dancing to the piano music. 
An email will be sent to the user, with several codes which play different tunes and there will also be a demo button which plays a certain song. 
Our target audience is children between the ages 2-10. In the final product, there will be no small parts that could potentially be choking hazards for young children. It’s a unisex toy.
