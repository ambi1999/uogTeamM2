Purpose of the meeting.

-Deciding on project for semester two assignment.
Minutes:
Daniel Quinn
The project needs to involve a series of aspects like l.e.d lights and buttons because it is second semester work.

Ibrahim Jamal Al-lail
We should have a series of led lights that do different things when ever a different button is pressed, e.g. like a smiley face or something.

Daniel Quinn
We could make a Arduino piano using the push buttons and piezo speaker for the sound.

Ibrahim Jamal Al-lail
We could have led lights in the shape of a little man who dances whenever music is being played on the piano. 

Daniel Quinn
That would help us if we wanted to aim the project at children who want to learn piano so they would have a reason to keep playing and learning.

Ibrahim Jamal Al-lail
How many piano keys should we include because we are limited to the number of slots on the Arduino.

Daniel Quinn
We need to cover all the key note on the piano which I believe are:
•	A
•	B
•	C
•	D
•	E
•	F
•	G

But I don’t thing we will be able to cover the black keys because there isn’t enough space to work with.
Results of the meeting:

The group came to the conclusion that the project should be a piano that has a l.e.d. light man that dances you play and should be tailored towards a training tool for children. The project will include seven piano keys with all the notes ranging from a to g being covered and available on the kit.
